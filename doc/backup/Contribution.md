We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:
```
 Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

```
You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:
```
 git commit -s

```
