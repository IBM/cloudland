# CloudLand (The main development is moved to https://github.com/maplerime/cloudland)
Cloudland is a lightweight Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) framework designed to manage virtual machine instances, software-defined networks (SDN), storage volumes, and more. Capable of supporting over 10,000 hypervisors within a single cluster, Cloudland is well-suited to serve as the foundation for large-scale public cloud environments.   
   
In addition to its built-in multi-tenant support, Cloudland offers seamless integration with third-party authentication and authorization systems, making it an ideal solution for private cloud deployments or hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) setups.   
    
## Architecture overview

To support ultra-large scale, the hypervisors are organized into a tree hierarchy, the agents (scia are launched on demand)   

**Cloudlandâ€™s key distinguishing features include:**   
- Lightweight Architecture: Minimal components for a streamlined, efficient design.
- Easy Learning Curve: Simple for both developers and operators to get up to speed quickly.
- High-Performance Messaging: Optimized for fast and reliable internal message delivery.
- HPC-Based Scalability: Built on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) architecture, ensuring exceptional scalability.
- Self-Healing and Stable: Automatic failure recovery with robust stability for continuous operation.
- Customizable: Easily extensible to implement custom features and meet specific needs.
