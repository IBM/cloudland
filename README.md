# CloudLand

Cloudland, a light weight infrastructure as a service project, is a system framework to manage VM instances, software defined networks (SDN), volumes ... It can handle over 10 thousand of hypervisors in one cluster so it can be a base of large scale public cloud. It has OpenStack compatible API so it can be a straightforward alternative for private cloud or as a hyper converged infrastructure (HCI) solution.

Cloudland's main distinguishing features as compared to other IaaS systems are:
- Light weight, no tons of components
- Flat learning curve for both developers and operators
- Excellent performance for inside messages delivery
- Based on HPC architecture, so super scalable
- Self auto fail recovery and stable
- Easy to customize to implement your own feature

## Architecture overview

To support ultra-large scale, the hypervisors are organized into a tree hierarchy, the agents (scia are launched on demand)

## Install

There are two purposes of installing Cloudland

### For development
Development environment can be installed from an all-in-one node and then extended to multiple nodes of hypervisors.

### For production
Production environment can be self-incubated from a development environment -- the new control plane VMs with high availability are launched from the development environment and they take over the management of the cluster and turn it to production environment.
