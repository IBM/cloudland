# CloudLand
Cloudland is a lightweight Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) framework designed to manage virtual machine instances, software-defined networks (SDN), storage volumes, and more. Capable of supporting over 10,000 hypervisors within a single cluster, Cloudland is well-suited to serve as the foundation for large-scale public cloud environments.   
   
In addition to its built-in multi-tenant support, Cloudland offers seamless integration with third-party authentication and authorization systems, making it an ideal solution for private cloud deployments or hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) setups.
