Create_a_key = Create a key
Create_a_key_content = To create a key, simply input key name and public key into fields and submit. If you don't have a key already, use command ssh-keygen -f /path/to/your_key to generate one. Most vm instances need a key to login.
Create_a_gateway = Create a gateway
Create_a_gateway_content = To create a gateway, input a gateway name and select one or multiple subnets to attach. The vm instances in the selected subnets can access the external network via the  gateway, and a floating ip can be bound to an instance only after a gateway is created.
Launch_an_instance = Launch an instance
Launch_an_instance_content = To launch an instance, specify the fields with star including hostname, count, image, flavor and primary interface. It is also important to select a proper key to login the instance after it gets created.
Create_a_floating_IP = Create a floating IP
Create_a_floating_IP_content = To create a floating ip, select the instance name with address in the drop down menu, choose floating ip type to be public to get an public floating ip. Private floating ip can be an internal access endpoint when needed. Leaving it blank means to create both.
Use_your_instance_and_modify_security_group_as_needed = Use your instance and modify security group as needed
ssh_key_login_cmd = ssh -i /path/to/your_private_key username@instance_public_floating_ip
Use_your_instance_content = username is centos for centos image, core for coreos image and ubuntu for ubuntu image by default. To expose a service you setup in the instance publicly, click security group id in the security group panel and create a new rule. For example, to open port 443, specify 0.0.0.0/0 for remote ip, ingress for direction, tcp for protocol, both portmin and portmax to be 443.
